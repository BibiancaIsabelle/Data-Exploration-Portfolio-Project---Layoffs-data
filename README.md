# Data Analysis Portfolio Project Layoff data
In this project I use SQL to Analyze layoff data around the world. I use queries to investigate which companies had the most layoffs as well as how many layoffs occured each month. Furthermore, I analyzed in which stage and in what countries companies had the most layoffs. Lastly, I also looked at what industries experienced the most layoffs.
